<p>
    Kattuveera Anjaneya Temple is located at Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu is said to be 2500 years old and this Anjaneya here ensures that the one wish which one pray with full devotion is said to come true, within 3 months.
    The devotee has to complete 11 rounds of the temple chanting the mantra “sri Ram jai Ram Jai Jai Jai Ram” and once the 11 pradikshna is over then the saffron bag is kept along with the other devotees bags separately for 3 months. It is believed that the one wish which you want to be fulfilled gets fulfilled, and once the wish is fulfilled you are expected to return and claim the saffron bag from the temple.
    There is one natural rock formation Nandi which one cannot miss and shows the presence of shiva too here.
